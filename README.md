# Wave Extractor
Extract WAVE files from an archive (that is neither encrypted nor compressed). Useful for extracting music from a PC game's archive (which is a file that contains all the files used in the game).

The extracted WAVE files will be named after the address in the archive that the WAVE file was found at.
